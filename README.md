# project overview

Throughout life we go through hard times and some of us are fortunate enough to meet people who can ease those troubles even by just a little bit. I am one of the fortunate ones to have found people who became my light and helped me realize what I can do in life. Magic Shop by BTS shows vulnerabity and greatly showcases my community - my found family that include the people that are dear to me in life. Throughout this journey they have helped me realized the best that I can do and I have also helped them realize the best that they can do. The words within these lyrics resonate with me and how I feel with my community. Explore this website to get a feel of what can be felt through my sense of community.
