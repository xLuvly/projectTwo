# project overview
### Inspired by the vulnerability of these lyrics, this showcases the community I found with my friends and my boyfriend. The words and lyrics resonate with me on a deep level and it is shown throughout as you explore this website.

# technical overview
### Practices using transitions and the tools under it such as scale, skew, transforms, etc to showcase the text through animation. With the practices it is made to seem like a galaxy and convey which parts are heavy and which parts are comfort.
